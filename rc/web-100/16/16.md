<!----><div><h1>Introduction to Templating Engines</h1>
<p>In this Topic, we will cover the following Learning Units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Templating Engines</li>
<li>Template Components</li>
<li>Logical vs Logicless templating engines</li>
</ul>
<p>Each learner moves at their own pace, but this Topic should take
approximately 4.5 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Templating engines, such as Jinja, Jade or Mustache, have become
important tools for quickly setting up templates that allow us to
isolate presentation logic in a way that allows front-end developers
to be productive without requiring a deep understanding of the back-end.</p>
<p>When creating software products, scalability and maintainability are
very important factors. We are going to explore how templating engines
can generate <em>templates</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> that can help us achieve those
goals and ensure our source code is more legible and front-end code is
not excessively mixed with business logic.</p>
<p>Next, we'll examine the functionality that templating engines provide,
and how this can fall outside the desired scope of the presentation
layer.</p>
<p>Finally, we will explore the differences between logical and logicless
templating engines.</p>

<h2>Model View Controller Architecture</h2>

<div class="markdown-content text-main-color flex-grow my-6 mx-auto"><!----><div><p>In the earlier days of software development, it was common to create
applications without taking scalability and maintainability into
account. Mixing business, presentation, and data access logic used to
be common practice.</p>
<p>One proposed solution is called <em>N-tier architecture</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
The goal of tiered applications is to define clear separations between
different groups of application concerns. This approach provides
improved code readability, as well as a better way to distribute
work among many developers, since each tier of an application can be
seen as an independent component that interacts with other tiers via
previously-defined interfaces.</p>
<p>One software development pattern that follows the n-tier paradigm is
called <em>Model-View-Controller</em> (MVC).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> It was created
for Smalltalk by Trygve Reenskaug. The way MVC divides application
concerns is by separating three aspects: data access, business logic,
and presentation logic.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In our MVC example, <em>Models</em> interact directly with the database
engine or any other data source we are using for our application.
When interacting with databases, this layer is often created using
<em>Object Relational Mapping</em> (ORM)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> frameworks to create a
mapping between database tables and objects that can be used on our
application.</p>
<p><em>Views</em> handle the presentation of the data after it has been
processed. This is where templating engines reside. In the case of
web applications, the View layer ideally can be coded by front-end
developers who can focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, only expecting
dynamic values from the controller.</p>
<p><em>Controllers</em> orchestrate the interactions between the Models and
Views. They also handle the business logic in every aspect. Among
other things, Controllers are linked to URLs that they will handle.
Controllers also receive parameters, validate them, then ask the Model
to extract any information required from the database. The outputs
are then formatted as required so that they can be used by the View.
It is important to note that Views are decoupled from Controllers.
This means that under specific circumstances, a Controller could
use different Views and that a View can be used by more than one
Controller.</p>
<p>Some improvements have been made to MVC. Proposed architectures
<em>Model-View-Presenter</em> (MVP)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> and <em>Model-View-ViewModel</em>
(MVVM)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> apply specific changes to MVC to gain benefits. It
is important to note that the differences are somewhat subtle, so the
line that separates these paradigms from each other can be blurry.</p>
<p>In the case of MVP, the Controller is replaced by a Presenter that
aims to remove logic from Views by creating contracts (interfaces)
to interact with them. The main advantage of this approach is that we
gain testability because Views can be mocked during tests.</p>
<p>In MVVM, we take advantage of data-binding the View to the Model so
that changes to the data happening via the View can trigger events as
required.</p>
<p>To summarize, MVC is important because it allows us to define clear
boundaries in our code. It also improves maintainability, making it
easier for larger teams of developers to work on the same project
while minimizing risk of conflicting efforts. This also means
specialists can focus on their area of expertise seamlessly without
needing to learn about other components. Developers working on
business logic, for example, do not need to worry about the front-end.</p>
