<!----><div><h1>Introduction to Burp Suite</h1>
<p>In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser and Integration</li>
<li>Proxy and Scope</li>
<li>The Core Burp Suite Tools and Tabs</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start by discussing <em>Burp Suite</em>,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> one of the most
popular tools for penetration testing. Burp Suite is an integrated
platform for web application security testing and auditing. It
consists of multiple tools and capabilities targeted at testing web
applications. Burp Suite will be one of our go-to tools from the early
stages of mapping out an application through carrying out an attack.</p>
<p>We'll be approaching this new tool one section at a time; however,
please proceed at a pace that is comfortable as we tackle the most
important aspects of Burp Suite.</p>
<p>The concepts discussed in this Learning Module will be key to our
future success in Offensive Security's WEB-200 and WEB-300 courses.</p>
<p>As a web assessor, Burp Suite is going to be our home more than 90% of
the time.</p>

<!----><div><h2>Browser and Integration</h2>
<p>This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to launch Burp Suite from Kali Linux</li>
<li>Understand how to use Burp Suite's built-in browser.</li>
<li>Understand how we can integrate Burp Suite with other browsers.</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing our web assessments, we're going to be in one of two
browsers for the majority of our testing period. Most commonly, we
make use of Burp Suite's built-in browser</p>
<p>This is the most effective browser for testing
because of its direct integration into Burp Suite.</p>
<p>However, before we had Burp Suite's built-in browser, we had to do
things a little differently. In the past, it was most efficient to
configure Mozilla Firefox as our testing browser by adjusting its
network and proxy settings.</p>
<p>In this Learning Unit, we're going to be discussing how to work with,
and intercept requests from, both browser options.</p>

<h2>Launching Burp Suite</h2>

<div class="markdown-content text-main-color flex-grow my-6 mx-auto"><!----><div><p>Burp Suite is an integrated platform for web application security
testing and auditing. Rather than being a singular tool, it consists
of multiple tools targeted at testing web applications. Burp Suite
will be one of our go-to tools from the early stages of mapping out
the application through carrying out an attack. Regardless of which
version of Burp Suite we use, the one present on our Kali Linux
attacking machine is enough for our needs.</p>
<p>Throughout this Learning Module, we'll be using our sandbox as a means
of working hands-on with the material. Let's start the VM in the
<em>Resources</em> section at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>This will launch the VM for our exercises, and if we are not connected
to the VPN, we are also going to be able to access a browser-based
Kali instance.</p>
<p>Now we need to create an entry in our <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> file so that
we can access the VM.</p>
<pre id="fence-code-1" class="fence-code"><code>127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

<span class="code-block-p">192.168.50.160 offsecwp</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Listing 1 - Hosts File Configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our resources configured, we're now ready to open Burp Suite,
which is installed by default on Kali Linux.</p>
<p>We need to open Kali's main menu on the upper left of the desktop,
then we need to expand the section called <em>Web Application Analysis</em>,
and there we'll find Burp Suite's entry to open it.</p>
<p>

<figcaption>Figure 1: Burp Suite - Opening the application</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>After our initial launch, we'll notice a warning that Burp Suite has
not been tested on our JRE. Since the Kali team always tests Burp
Suite on the Java version shipped with the Operating System, we can
safely ignore this warning.</p>
<p>

</figure>
<p></p>
<p>We'll avoid spending too much time with Project Options and click
<em>Next</em> to continue. The free version of Burp Suite does not permit
project use, so we can skip this for the time being. Let's click
<em>Next</em> to move on to the update page.</p>
<p>

<figcaption>Figure 3: Burp - Update</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>If we get the message, we can click <em>Close</em> since we don't want to
update right now. Therefor, we'll just click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p>We then receive a request to select a configuration, shown in the
figure below.</p>
<p>
</p><figure>

<p></p>
<p>Burp Suite allows us to export and import project configurations
depending on our workflow needs. Since this is our first time starting
Burp, let's keep the defaults and click <em>Start Burp</em>.</p>

<h2>Using Burp Suite’s Built-in Browser</h2>

<div class="markdown-content text-main-color flex-grow my-6 mx-auto"><!----><div><p>Burp Suite provides its own native built-in web browser based on
<em>Chromium</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Let's familiarize ourselves with this tool
first.</p>
<p>After launching Burp Suite, we'll click on the <em>Proxy</em> tab, then the
<em>Open Browser</em> button.</p>
<p>
</p><figure>
<img src="https://offsec-platform-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/offsec-courses/WEB-100/images/intro-to-burp-suite/38c2c3e9b0a7faac09c73124012d44b3-burp-proxy-highlight.png" alt="Figure 5: The " open="" browser"="" button."="">
<figcaption>Figure 5: The "Open Browser" Button.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>Next, a browser window will appear.</p>
<p>
</p><figure>

<figcaption>Figure 6: Burp's Built-In Browser</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>With the <em>Intercept</em> button de-activated, Burp's Proxy will
automatically forward the requests the browser makes to the server.
Regardless of the state of the <em>Intercept</em> button, Burp Suite will store
the requests we send.</p>
<p>In the coming sections, we'll further discuss the tabs displayed
within Burp Suite.</p>
<p>Next, we'll configure a web browser to communicate with Burp Suite
over port 8080 via the proxy configuration.</p>
<section class="footnote-container"><div class="footnote-item" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup><p>(Chromium.org, 2023), <a href="https://www.chromium.org/" target="_blank">https://www.chromium.org/</a> <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<h2>Integrating Burp Suite with Other Browsers</h2>

<div class="markdown-content text-main-color flex-grow my-6 mx-auto"><!----><div><p>Before we move on to some of the other tools in Burp Suite,
let's demonstrate how to configure another browser to use Burp
Suite as a proxy. In Firefox, we can do this by navigating to
<strong>about:preferences#advanced</strong>, scrolling down to <em>Network
Settings</em>, and then clicking <em>Settings</em>.</p>
<p>Here we'll choose the <em>Manual</em> option, setting the appropriate IP
address and listening port. In our case, the proxy and browser
reside on the same host, so we'll use the loopback interface and
specify port 8080. However, if we planned on using the proxy to
intercept traffic from multiple machines, we would use the public IP
address of the machine running the proxy for this setting. Also worth
noting is that we could set this value to an internal LAN IP.</p>
<section class="sb-block"><p>Burp Suite will listen by default on the loopback interface,
therefore if we need to make it listen on another interface, we would
need to make that change within Burp Suite itself.</p></section>
<p>Finally, we also want to check <em>Use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS</em> to
make sure that we can intercept every request while testing the target
application.</p>
<p>
</p><figure>
<img src="https://offsec-platform-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/offsec-courses/WEB-100/images/intro-to-burp-suite/5be21d2df4c43d524be69ba0a65f8836-tm_firefox_cfg_01.png" alt="Figure 7: Firefox Proxy Configuration.">
<figcaption>Figure 7: Firefox Proxy Configuration.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>Note that once we configure Firefox in this way, we will need Burp
Suite running to access any website. To stop using Burp Suite as a
proxy, we must return to connection settings and select <em>Use system
proxy settings</em> or <em>No proxy</em>. Alternatively, we could use any number
of browser add-ons (such as <em>FoxyProxy</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>) to switch between proxy
server settings.</p>
<section class="footnote-container"><div class="footnote-item" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup><p>(FoxyProxy, 2023), <a href="https://getfoxyproxy.org/" target="_blank">https://getfoxyproxy.org/</a> <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
