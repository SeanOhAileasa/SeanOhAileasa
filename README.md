"update repository ./cta-recursion - When designing a recursive algorithm the most fundamental step is to think about the task to be accomplished and identify recurring patterns. Identify cases known can be solved without recursion (simple base cases). Invoke a new copy of the method within each recursive step. Each recursive step resembles the original larger problem. Make progress towards the base case with each successive recursive step."

"update repository ./cta-sorting - Bubble Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that achieves in-place sorting. Time complexity linear in the best-case and quadratic (polynomial) in the worst and average-cases. Slow and impractical for most problems when compared to Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. Only use case is for data that is nearly sorted or very small input albeit Insertion Sort is still probably better. Repeating leftmost starts comparing each element except the last element (depending on the iteration count) with its neighbour to the right and if out of order then swap resulting in the largest element now at the final position. Collection becomes partitioned into two whereby the larger values bubble up to the top (sorted to the right).
